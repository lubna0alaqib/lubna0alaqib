    "### 3.1. Detecting anomalies in a manufacturing process using sensor data without prior knowledge of specific anomaly patterns\n",
    "**Type:** Unsupervised\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:** Since the task involves detecting unknown anomaly patterns without labeled data, unsupervised learning algorithms like clustering or anomaly detection (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN, Isolation Forest) are appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2. Predicting customer lifetime value based on historical transaction data and customer demographics\n",
    "**Type:** Supervised\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:** This problem involves predicting a specific value (customer lifetime value) based on labeled historical data. Supervised learning algorithms like regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression) are suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3. Segmenting customer demographics based on their purchase history, browsing behavior, and preferences\n",
    "**Type:** Unsupervised\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:** The task requires discovering inherent groupings or segments in the data without predefined labels. Unsupervised learning algorithms like clustering (e.g., k-means, hierarchical clustering) are appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4. Analyzing social media posts to categorize them into different themes\n",
    "**Type:** Unsupervised\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:** Categorizing social media posts into themes without predefined labels involves discovering natural groupings in the data. Unsupervised learning algorithms like topic modeling (e.g., LDA) or clustering can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Semi-Supervised Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1. Predicting fraudulent financial transactions using a dataset where most transactions are labeled as fraudulent or legitimate\n",
    "**Appropriate:** No\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:** Since most transactions are labeled, this is best handled by supervised learning algorithms like logistic regression or random forests, which can utilize the labeled data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2. Analyzing customer satisfaction surveys where only a small portion of the data is labeled with satisfaction ratings\n",
    "**Appropriate:** Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:** Semi-supervised learning is suitable here as it can leverage the small labeled dataset along with the large unlabeled dataset to improve the model's performance. Algorithms like semi-supervised SVM or graph-based methods can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3. Identifying spam emails in a dataset where the majority of emails are labeled\n",
    "**Appropriate:** No\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:** With most emails labeled, supervised learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, or neural networks are more appropriate to effectively classify the emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4. Predicting the probability of default for credit card applicants based on their complete financial and credit-related information\n",
    "**Appropriate:** No\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:** This problem typically has a well-labeled dataset, making supervised learning algorithms like logistic regression or decision trees more suitable for predicting the default probability.\n"
