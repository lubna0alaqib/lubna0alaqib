    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "The code splits the data into training and test sets, with 20% of the data used for testing.\n",
    "The features are scaled using StandardScaler to improve convergence.\n",
    "The logistic regression model is created with an increased maximum number of iterations (max_iter=1000) to allow for convergence.\n",
    "The model is trained on the scaled training data.\n",
    "Predictions are made on the scaled test data.\n",
    "The accuracy score represents the overall percentage of correct predictions made by the model.\n",
    "The classification report provides more detailed metrics for each class (0 for non-diabetic and 1 for diabetic):\n",
    "Precision: The proportion of correct positive predictions.\n",
    "Recall: The proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified.\n",
    "F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n",
    "Support: The number of instances in each class.\n",
    "Note: Since this is a classification problem, the R-squared metric is not applicable. R-squared is typically used for regression problems to measure the model's goodness-of-fit. For classification problems, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are more relevant."
